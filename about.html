  <u>Background</u>
  <br>I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a> at Northwestern University,
  advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Todd D. Murphey</a>.
  I am part of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent
  Autonomy Lab</a>, where our research focuses on computational methods in data-driven control,
  information theory in physical systems, and embodied intelligence.

  <br><br>I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://ame.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>
  in 2016 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2018.
  I was also awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">Graduate Research Fellowship</a> in 2018.

  <u>Research Interests</u>
  <br>I am interested in how to optimally design robots -- by taking into account the relationship between
  hardware (including physical shape, sensors, and actuators),
  software (control policies, planning algorithms, and learning architecture),
  and the robot's goal.

  How should a robot's control strategy change depending on its morphology, and vice versa?

  Should it change its plan if a sensor breaks? Or should it adjust its morphology (e.g., lengthen a limb)
  if it learns something new about its environment?


  <br><br>
  In nature, biological organisms jointly evolve both their morphology and their neurological capabilities to improve their chances for survival.
  Consequently, task information is encoded both in their brains and their bodies.
  In robotics, the development of complex control and planning algorithms often bears sole responsibility for improving task performance.
  My work attempts to reduce the dependence on centralized control (especially for minimal systems and agents on the microscale, where there are
  computational limitations) for task execution by algorithmically designing and iterating on both a robot's controller and its physical body.


  <br><br>
  My <a href="/index">projects</a> approach this problem from different angles.
  In my <a href="/#robot-comparisons">Robot Comparisons</a> project,
  I analyzed the information requirements for microrobots to achieve a goal with different combinations of sensors and actuators.

  Similarly, in the <a href="/#collective-behaviors">Collective Behaviors and Emergent Computation</a>
  project my collaborators and I identified and exploited emergent behaviors in a system of minimal robots.
  We found that the collective actions the simple robots were physically capable of greatly reduced the necessary complexity of a controller.

  Next, in my <a href="/#algorithmic-design">Algorithmic Design of Minimal Robots</a> work,
  I developed a methodology for algorithmically arranging sensing and actuation components into a robot design while maintaining a low
  level of design complexity, suitable for the constraints of the microrobots my collaborators at MIT were manufacturing.

  Those microrobots were also the motivation for my <a href="/#bayesian-particles">Bayesian Particles</a> project,
  in which I modelled minimal agents (particles) navigating through the human circulatory system, collectively executing a Bayesian update.
  The agents work in parallel to collaboratively find a target and use only six bits of memory each.

  Lastly, my most recent project, <a href="/#flexible-tool">Co-Design of a Tool and Strategy</a>, brings this idea to the macroscale.
  I am enabling a robot to not only use a tool to assist it in accomplishing a task,
  but allowing the robot to design that tool by bending a flexible wire into a useful shape.

  These projects relate in their goals of offloading some of a robot's computational effort from a centralized controller onto the the robot's morphology,
  and taking advantage of existing structures and emergent properties native to the robotic system.
  <!-- These projects relate in their goals of amplifying and exploiting the physical and emergent capabilities of systems instead of adding more and more control complexity to achieve similar results. -->
