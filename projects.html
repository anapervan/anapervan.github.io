<!-- <h3>Designing a tool and strategy simultaneously</h3>
  <p>In progress
  <br>   <br><br><b>Design Sensitivities.</b>
    Robot performance is clearly sensitive to changes in design, and determining how much
    a robot might benefit from the addition of different components or other morphologial changes
    could greatly impact a robot's capabilities.

    <br><br>For example, how does one determine the sensitivity of the design of a robotic leg (intended
    for walking) to the introduction of a knee? How does it affect the robot if the
    knee is a simple revolute joint, or if it has a motor? I am currently investigating this problem,
    both through the lens of reinforcement learning and using methods from switched systems theory.</p> -->


<h3>Bayesian Particles</h3>
  <p>Physically limited learning particles collaborating (and working in parallel) to navigate random graphs.
  <br>Through collaboration with chemical engineers at MIT, including
    <a href="https://albert-t-liu.com/">Albert T. Liu</a>, I have been
     considering the problem of designing microscopic robots to achieve complex
     goals in a stochastic environment (for example, navigating the circulatory
     system to assisst in an immune response), where they might have to change
     their control policies, communicate with each other, and deal with uncertainty
      -- all with minimal capabilities and only a few bits of memory. This
      project is in progress, and it is an exciting combination of my earlier
      work in algorithmic robot design and collective and emergent behaviors.

<h3>Algorithmic Design for Embodied Intelligence</h3>
  <p> A conflict exists between equipping a robot with what is sufficient and
    what is necessary—what can enable a robot to succeed (and is likely complex)
    and what is minimally required for it to achieve its goal (and is
    necessarily simple). This is especially evident when designing for embodied
    computation—robots without any on-board, CPU-based, traditional computational
    capabilities. An iterative algorithm is introduced to compute feasible
    control policies that achieve a desired objective while maintaining a low
    level of design complexity and a high level of task embodiment.

<h3>Primitives and Logic for Robot Comparisons</h3>
  <p> Inspired by micro-scale robotic systems and active matter, I (along with
    my collaborators) examine several different robot designs and systems. We
    perform a task-centered formal analysis of several robot designs, emphasizing
    the information requirements of goal completion under different initial
    conditions, as well as what is required to recognize irreparable task
    failure. We also examine the role of boundary conditions in a heterogenous
    active matter system in a bounded domain.

<h3>Collective Behaviors and Emergent Computation</h3>
  <p>The main element of emergent behavior is the ability of the local
  sensing and actuation of individuals to result in significant, global
  capabilities of the collective. To identify and exploit emergent behaviors, we
  examined the information that motion and dynamics carry about the underlying
  task being executed. We define \emph{task embodiment} as the amount of task
  information encoded in an agent’s motions, and use it to take advantage of
  broken symmetries in a system and execute sophisticated collective behaviors
  --- all with minimal, local sensing and actuation capabilities.
