<h2>About</h2>
<body>

  <p>I am a fourth year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University
    advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Todd Murphey</a>.
    I am part of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent
    Autonomy Lab</a>, where our research focuses on computational methods in data-driven control,
    information theory in physical systems, and embodied intelligence.

<p><b>Education and Background.</b> I recieved my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://ame.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>
in 2016 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2018.
I was also awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship in 2018.</p>

<p><b>Research Interests.</b> I am interested in algorithmic design of robots for embodied intelligence and
  methodologies for autonomously identifying and exploiting emergence in collective systems.</p>

<p><b>Other Interests.</b> Traveling and painting (and learning HTML)</p>
