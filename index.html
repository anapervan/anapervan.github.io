<h2>About</h2>

<body>
  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a> at Northwestern University,
    advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Todd D. Murphey</a>.
    I am part of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent
    Autonomy Lab</a>, where our research focuses on computational methods in data-driven control,
    information theory in physical systems, and embodied intelligence.

  <br><br>I recieved my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://ame.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>
  in 2016 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2018.
  I was also awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">Graduate Research Fellowship</a> in 2018.

  <br><br>I am interested in algorithmic design of robots for embodied intelligence and
    methodologies for autonomously identifying and exploiting emergence in collective systems.
