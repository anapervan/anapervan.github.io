    <h2>Research</h2>

<body>
  <p>Artificial life is often thought of as complicated, expensive, large-scale
    implementations of humanoid robots, but the first life-like robotic behaviors
    may be the result of simple interactions collectively producing emergent behaviors.

 <br><br>Both the design of sensing, computation, and actuation components of <i>individual</i> robots, and
predicting and understanding the <i>collective</i> interactions of groups of agents
composed of these elements, are key to developing properties like self-organization
and emergent computation.</p>

<h3>Algorithmic Robot Design</h3>
<p>Robots traditionally require three elements: sensors, computation, and actuators.
  How should robots be algorithmically designed using an existing library of these components?
  <!-- To algorithmically design a robot, one might start with an existing library
of sensors and actuators and compare the task performance of robots consisting
of every possible combination of these components. This method is not only
inelegant, but it can quickly become infeasible—and it doesn’t take into account
the actual capabilities of each of these components. So how should individual
robots be designed for specific tasks? -->

<br><br><b>Design Sensitivities.</b>
Robot performance is clearly sensitive to changes in design, and I am interested in
determining how much a robot could benefit from the addition of different
components or other morphologial changes.

<br><br>For example, how does one
 determine the sensitivity of the design of a robotic leg (intended
for walking) to the introduction of a knee? How does it affect the robot if the
knee is a simple revolute joint, or if it has a motor? I am currently investigating this problem,
both through the lens of reinforcement learning and using methods from switched systems theory.

<br><br><b>Combinatoric Components.</b>
Another facet of robot design is the combinatorics of components. Sensors
and actuators are by no means independent components on a
robot. For example, a camera (which is a sensor) is useless at night without
a flashlight (an actuator, of sorts). Likewise, a flashlight is of no benefit to a
robot that doesn’t have a camera.

<br><br>For control, exploitable sensor-actuator pairs are valuable. In my <a href="publications">Master's Thesis</a>,
as well as a <a href="publications">book chapter</a>, I introduced a method for
designing a simple robot when given a finite library of sensors and actuators.


<br><br><b>Information Flow.</b>
A central idea in robot design is information flow from the environment to
the robot. What is the relationship between the body of a robot and its desired task,
without control? If the relative entropy between the initial conditions of the
robot and the goal task is a small number (meaning that the goal task is not
far from the initial conditions of the robot), then not much control information
is necessary to achieve the task. In other words, if a task is well embodied by a robot, only a simple
control policy is necessary to execute it. Otherwise more information, in the
form of a complex control policy, is necessary.

<br><br><i>Task embodiment</i> is a measure of how much information a body encodes
about a task. Changing a robot design can be thought of in terms of moving
task information from the centralized computations in the control calculations
to embedded computation in the physical body. This principle of information
flow, and trade-offs of having control information be in the physical design of
the body or in the computerized controller of the robot, are one way to formally
think about robot designs. I introduced the concept of task embodiment in two publictions:
a <a href="publications">WAFR paper</a> and a <a href="publications">RA-L paper</a>.
</p>

<h3>Collective Behaviors and Emergent Computation</h3>
<p>I am interested in predicting the emergent properties of a collection of individual
robots, and synthesizing these behaviors through the design of algorithmic and
physical properties of each individual. The main element of emergent
behavior is the ability of the local sensing and actuation of (potentially simple) individuals
to result in global ensemble-level capabilities that are greater than what should
be expected from such simple capabilities. How can a methodology be formed with
which goals for the ensemble can be transformed into physical designs of individual
robots?

<br><br><b>Stochastic Robotics.</b>
First, emergent behaviors must be able to be identified and exploited. This was demonstrated
in the [SR] paper, where directed locomotion was achieved through stochastic interactions.
A nonparametric algorithm was used to take advantage of broken symmetries in the system
and execute sophisticated collective behaviors, all with minimal sensing and actuation capabilities.

<br><br><b>Reinforcement Learning in Particle Robots.</b>
Through collaboration with a chemical engineering lab at MIT, including
<a href="https://albert-t-liu.com/">Albert T. Liu</a>, I have been
considering the problem of designing microscopic robots (known as synthetic cells)
 to achieve a complex goal (e.g., mimicking the immune system by seeking invaders)
in a complex environment (e.g., the circulatory system), where they might have
to change their control policy, communicate with each other, and deal with uncertainty
including false positives and negatives --- all with minimal capabilities and only
a few bits of memory.

<br><br>In a paper that has not yet been published, I demonstrate that synthetic
cells can work together to find a target (or a moving target, or multiple targets)
by performing a reinforcement learning-type alrogithm with which they update their
control policy based on randomized envounters with other cells. As the synthetic
cells work together to find the target(s) their interactions as an ensemble
function as a physical implementation of a Bayesian update. That is, the particles
act as a particle filter.</p>
